          <h3>About Effy</h3>
            <p><b>Effy Elden is a 23-year-old non-binary person, who works as a consultant software developer in Melbourne.</b> As an avid technologist and a proud trans girl, they passionately pursue activism in the fields of digital privacy and queer rights. As a Pascoe Vale local, they want the greatest possible representation for their community in parliament, and believe the Greens are the best party for the job.</p>
            <p>Coming to the Greens as a volunteer for Scott Ludlam’s awe-inspiring 2014 by-election campaign, Effy quickly became a key technical resource, joining the WA IT Working Group and helping to create WA’s phonebanking infrastructure. They moved to Melbourne shortly afterwards, coming on as Victorian Greens Technology Manager in the lead-up to the breakthrough 2014 state election.</p>
            <p>Effy continued to work for the party for the next four years. Their experiences both as a staff member and a passionate volunteer have driven them to stand as a preselection candidate for Pascoe Vale, and campaign on the issues that affect their community and our state. Effy hopes to one day be the first proudly non-binary person in an Australian parliament.</p>
